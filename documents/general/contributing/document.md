# Contribution Guide

## Contributing Content

The Unreal Archive currently consists of three main content types:

- **Game Content**: Automatically categorised and indexed user-created game content for Unreal, Unreal Tournament and Unreal Tournament 2004. 
- **Articles/Documents**: Help, guides, and reference articles for the games.
- **Managed Content**: Content or updates which cannot be automatically classified, for example patches or alternative renderers.

All of this content is defined within [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) files and stored within a dedicated Git repository at
https://github.com/unreal-archive/content.
